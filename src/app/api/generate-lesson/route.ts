- Include: coaching language, success strategies, self-advocacy prompts, growth mindset reinforcement, connection to personal growth
- Tone: Warm, empowering, second-person voice aligned with Rootwork Framework
- Length: 1-2 sentences maximum
- Must support student agency and emotional regulation

Placement Rules:
- Notes appear immediately after activity descriptions, before MTSS supports
- Both note types required for every major lesson component (Opening, I Do, We Do, You Do Together, You Do Alone, Closing)
- No lesson component may be generated without both note types
- Notes must maintain therapeutic Rootwork Framework context throughout

LESSON REQUIREMENTS:
Grade Level: ${cleanData.gradeLevel}
Number of Days: ${cleanData.numberOfDays}
Minutes per Day: ${cleanData.minutes}

TEACHER'S STANDARDS & OBJECTIVES DESCRIPTION:
${cleanData.standards || 'No specific standards provided - please generate grade-appropriate learning objectives that align with Root Work Framework principles and common educational standards for this grade level.'}

TEACHER'S FOCUS AREA & CONSIDERATIONS:
${cleanData.focusArea || 'No specific focus area provided - please incorporate trauma-informed practices, cultural responsiveness, and differentiation strategies appropriate for diverse learners.'}

üéØ Objective: Generate a ${cleanData.numberOfDays}-day, student-facing lesson plan that integrates:
- Trauma-informed care (SAMHSA 6 Principles)
- STEAM and Project-Based Learning

The lesson must include resources or explicit instructions to create the following:
- Student-facing templates
- Multimedia links or embedded tools
- Assessment rubrics
- Peer/self-reflection tools
- Garden or nature-based regulation rituals

üßæ MANDATORY Output Format - Each Component Required:

For each lesson day, provide in this exact order:

HEADER SECTION:
- Day #, Lesson Title, Essential Question, "I Can" Learning Target, Standards, DOK Level
- [Teacher Note: Pedagogical context for this lesson's objectives and trauma-informed considerations]
- [Student Note: What you're building toward and why it matters for your growth]

STRUCTURED LESSON FLOW:

Opening (10-15 minutes)
- Activity description with specific instructions
- [Teacher Note: Facilitation tips, trauma-informed considerations, and Rootwork Framework connections]
- [Student Note: Coaching language for engagement and self-regulation strategies]

I Do: Direct Instruction (15-20 minutes)
- Content and modeling description

- Specific Accommodation Categories:
  * 504 Accommodations
  * Gifted Learner Extensions  
  * SPED Modifications
- Co-teaching Model Integration (specify model used)
- Reteaching Plans (for students needing additional support)

üîç MANDATORY NOTES QUALITY CHECK: Before finalizing any lesson component, verify it contains:
- [Teacher Note: ] with specific pedagogical guidance addressing trauma-informed practice
- [Student Note: ] with encouraging coaching language supporting student agency
- Both notes align with Rootwork Framework therapeutic principles
- Notes address the healing-centered educational context appropriately
- If ANY component lacks both note types, regenerate entire lesson component

üõë FINAL GENERATION PROTOCOL:
1. Generate lesson plan with mandatory teacher/student notes in every component
2. Verify notes appear in prescribed [Teacher Note: ] and [Student Note: ] format throughout
3. Confirm therapeutic Rootwork Framework context maintained in all notes
4. Run final check ensuring no component lacks both note types
5. Validate that all notes address trauma-informed practice and student agency
6. Only output complete lesson if ALL validation criteria met, including note requirements

üß≠ Mode Selection: Full Unit Generation with Project-Based Learning Focus

üß† CRITICAL LLM Behavioral Constraints:
1. NEVER generate any lesson component without both [Teacher Note: ] and [Student Note: ]
2. If notes are missing from any section, STOP and regenerate that section completely
3. Teacher notes MUST address trauma-informed facilitation in every lesson component
4. Student notes MUST use encouraging, second-person coaching voice aligned with Rootwork Framework
5. Notes appear BEFORE MTSS supports in each section
6. Do not fabricate links, tools, or citations. If needed, generate a placeholder (e.g. "[Insert Flipgrid link here]").
7. Do not label elements as "TIC" or "CASEL" ‚Äî embed them naturally and substantively.
8. Use warm, empowering second-person voice in student-facing instructions.
9. Assume a ${cleanData.minutes}-minute block schedule by default.
10. Use sensory-friendly metaphors, garden/nature references, and identity-rooted rituals.
11. Maintain therapeutic context and healing-centered approach throughout all components

INTELLIGENT INTERPRETATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If the teacher provided standards/objectives description, interpret their intent and create specific, measurable learning objectives that align with their description while incorporating Root Work principles.
2. If the teacher provided focus area description, interpret their needs and incorporate those elements throughout the lesson plan (differentiation, special populations, available resources, pedagogical approaches, etc.).
3. If either narrative box is empty, intelligently fill in appropriate content based on:
   - Grade level expectations
   - Root Work Framework principles
   - Best practices for trauma-informed education
   - Culturally responsive teaching methods
   - SEL integration

Create specific, actionable content that directly addresses the teacher's requirements while maintaining Root Work Framework principles throughout. Respond with detailed lesson plans that include all required components with mandatory teacher and student notes in every section.

CRITICAL: NEVER generate any lesson component without both [Teacher Note: ] and [Student Note: ]. Always ask clarifying questions to a 98% confidence level that you will develop what the user has requested, ensuring the therapeutic context of the Rootwork Framework is maintained throughout.
