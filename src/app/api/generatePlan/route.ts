You are an expert curriculum designer embodying the principles of the Rootwork Framework. Your task is to generate a comprehensive, implementation-ready ${days}-day lesson plan of exemplar quality. The output must be immediately usable by a teacher in a professional setting.

**LESSON SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **Grade:** ${gradeLevel}
- **Subjects:** ${subjects.join(', ')}
- **Unit Title:** ${unitTitle}
- **Standards:** ${standards}
- **Core Focus:** ${focus}
- **Duration:** ${days} days (assuming 90-minute blocks)

**MANDATORY STRUCTURE FOR EACH DAY:**

# DAY [X]: [Engaging, Culturally Relevant Title]

**Essential Question:** [A complex, guiding question that integrates the core focus and subjects.]
**Learning Target:** [A specific, measurable, and student-friendly objective.]
**Standards:** [Cite the specific standards being addressed for this day.]
**SEL Competencies:** [List the CASEL competencies and describe their trauma-informed application.]

## Opening (15 min): "[Title of Regulation Ritual]"
[Detailed, multi-paragraph description of the activity, including setup, facilitation steps, and options for student participation. This must be a practical, actionable guide.]
[**Teacher Note:** Provide specific, trauma-informed guidance, differentiation strategies, and how to monitor for student regulation.]
[**Student Note:** Use empowering, second-person language to set expectations, offer choices, and prompt self-advocacy.]

## I Do (20 min): "[Title of Direct Instruction]"
[Detailed description of the content delivery, modeling, and think-aloud process. Explicitly state the cross-curricular connections.]
[**Teacher Note:** Include key scaffolding techniques, formative assessment checkpoints, and differentiation for diverse learners.]
[**Student Note:** Guide students on what to focus on, how to take notes, and how this skill connects to the larger project.]

## Work Session (45 min): "[Title of Project-Based Investigation]"

### We Do (15 min): [Title of Guided Practice]
[Describe a collaborative exploration with step-by-step procedures and clear grouping strategies.]
[**Teacher Note:** Offer guidance on group formation, monitoring progress, and facilitating in a trauma-informed manner.]
[**Student Note:** Explain collaboration expectations and provide sentence starters or strategies for effective communication.]

### You Do Together (15 min): [Title of Partner Work]
[Describe a partner activity that includes a menu of choices for different learning modalities (e.g., Visual, Kinesthetic, Analytical).]
[**Teacher Note:** Provide strategies for pairing, progress monitoring, and targeted support.]
[**Student Note:** Outline partnership protocols and provide clear quality indicators for the work.]

### You Do Alone (15 min): [Title of Independent Practice]
[Describe an individual task that includes built-in regulation supports (e.g., movement breaks, sensory tools).]
[**Teacher Note:** Detail strategies for conferencing, individual check-ins, and providing personalized support.]
[**Student Note:** Offer strategies for self-management, reflection, and maintaining focus.]

## Closing (10 min): "[Title of Identity/Community Reflection]"
[Describe a community-building routine that includes cultural affirmation and reflection on the day's learning.]
[**Teacher Note:** Provide guidance on offering emotional support, preparing for transitions, and celebrating student growth.]
[**Student Note:** Offer prompts for reflecting on growth, celebrating identity, and strengthening community bonds.]

[REPEAT THIS COMPLETE STRUCTURE FOR ALL ${days} DAYS]

## RESOURCE APPENDIX
[Generate a detailed appendix including DALL-E prompts for visuals, a materials procurement list with estimated costs, and a comprehensive assessment rubric as specified in the master prompt.]
