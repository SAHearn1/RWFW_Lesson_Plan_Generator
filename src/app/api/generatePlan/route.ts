CRITICAL: Each day must include authentic STEAM integration where Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics are meaningfully woven together, not just mentioned separately.

Each Day Must Include:

# DAY X: [Title connecting all subjects with garden/nature metaphor]
Question: [Essential question requiring knowledge from ALL selected subjects]
Target: [Measurable goal demonstrating cross-curricular mastery]
Project Component: [Sophisticated multi-step creation requiring all disciplines]
STEAM Bridge: [Specific explanation of how S-T-E-A-M connect in this lesson]

[Teacher Note: Trauma-informed facilitation, specific differentiation strategies, assessment checkpoints]
[Student Note: Growth mindset language, agency building, connection to personal identity]

## Opening (15min): Garden-Based Regulation + Content Hook
[Nature-based grounding activity directly connecting to lesson content across all subjects]
Materials: [Specific sensory items, plants, or nature elements]
[Teacher Note: Dysregulation monitoring, cultural responsiveness, accessibility accommodations]
[Student Note: Self-regulation strategies, connection to personal/cultural knowledge]

## I Do (20min): Integrated Content Modeling
[Demonstrate how today's concepts connect across ALL selected subjects with specific examples and think-alouds]
Cross-curricular connections: [Explicit links between subjects with specific examples]
[Teacher Note: Scaffolding for diverse learners, visual/auditory/kinesthetic supports, assessment for understanding]
[Student Note: Active engagement strategies, note-taking methods that work for you, building on prior knowledge]

## Work Session (45min): Collaborative Investigation
### We Do (15min): Guided Multi-Disciplinary Problem-Solving
[Structured activity requiring knowledge from all subjects to solve authentic problem]
Authentic Assessment: [Real-world application demonstrating subject integration]
[Teacher Note: Collaborative grouping strategies, progress monitoring, peer support facilitation]
[Student Note: Communication skills, leveraging individual strengths, voice and choice in process]

### You Do Together (15min): Partnership Creation
[Partner work building sophisticated project components requiring multiple subject areas]
Choice Menu: [3-4 different pathways respecting learning preferences and strengths]
[Teacher Note: Formative assessment opportunities, conflict mediation, scaffolding supports]
[Student Note: Partnership strategies, self-advocacy skills, celebrating diverse perspectives]

### You Do Alone (15min): Individual Synthesis
[Independent work demonstrating personal understanding across subjects with multiple modalities]
Regulation Supports: [Built-in movement, choice, sensory breaks]
[Teacher Note: Individual conferencing, differentiated expectations, trauma-informed check-ins]
[Student Note: Self-management techniques, reflection on learning, personal goal setting]

## Closing (10min): Identity-Connected Reflection
[Reflective practice connecting learning to student identity, culture, and future aspirations]
Community Connection: [How today's learning connects to student's community and goals]
[Teacher Note: Emotional regulation support, culturally responsive validation, transition preparation]
[Student Note: Learning celebration, growth recognition, preparation for tomorrow's challenge]

Materials: [Comprehensive list including nature elements, technology, hands-on materials, texts]
MTSS: Tier 1: [Universal design features] | Tier 2: [Targeted supports] | Tier 3: [Intensive accommodations]
SEL: [Specific CASEL competencies with examples]
Assessment: [Formative checkpoints and authentic performance measures across all subjects]
Standards: [Specific alignment to provided standards with citations]
Extensions: [Accelerated learning options and community connections]

GENERATE ALL ${days} DAYS WITH AUTHENTIC CROSS-CURRICULAR INTEGRATION. ENSURE EVERY SELECTED SUBJECT IS MEANINGFULLY WOVEN THROUGHOUT EACH DAY.`;
