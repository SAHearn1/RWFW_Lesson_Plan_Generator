GENERATE ALL ${days} DAYS WITH AUTHENTIC CROSS-CURRICULAR INTEGRATION. ENSURE EVERY SELECTED SUBJECT IS MEANINGFULLY WOVEN THROUGHOUT EACH DAY.

## CRITICAL: RESOURCE GENERATION APPENDIX

After completing all lesson days, create a comprehensive Resource Generation Appendix with:

### A. IMAGE GENERATION PROMPTS
For each visual resource mentioned in lessons, provide detailed prompts for DALL-E/Copilot:
Format: "DALL-E Prompt for [Resource Name]: [Detailed 2-3 sentence description with style, colors, composition, and educational elements]"

### B. TEXT-BASED RESOURCES  
Generate actual content for text-based materials:
- Handout text and instructions
- Worksheet questions and answer keys
- Rubric criteria and scoring guides
- Student reflection prompts
- Assessment tools mentioned in lessons

### C. MATERIALS PROCUREMENT GUIDE
Specific sourcing information for physical materials mentioned, including:
- Where to obtain items
- Approximate costs
- Suitable alternatives
- Storage suggestions

GENERATE COMPLETE LESSON PLAN FIRST, THEN COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE APPENDIX.`;
